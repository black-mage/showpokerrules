<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
Show poker is the highly entertaining game where people are dealt 4 cards and instead of bidding with chips declare standard poker hands by showing cards in their hand. The winner at each round of betting gets to be the player who doesn’t have to pay to see the next card on the board. Theres a flop dealt before any declarations occur, and then declarations proceed in sequence until no other player wants to declare a better hand. Then every player gets the opportunity, in sequence from the highest hand, to either pay to see the next card or to fold their hand. There are 8 cards dealt onto the board in all including the flop, and after the final card is dealt, there is no betting, but the highest declared and shown hand takes the pot. Of course there’s plenty of potential to not show your hand until the final card is dealt and take the entire pot at that point. Which leads to all sorts of complex tactical play.
